# Vary-tiny

# Background
1. I found the original Vary [codebase](https://github.com/Ucas-HaoranWei/Vary) based on Huggingface makes it hard for loss to converge when epoch > 1, so I changed a codebase based on [LAVIS](https://github.com/salesforce/LAVIS).

2. [2024/4/19] The codebase will be public at the beginning of next week.
